# Cooking Style

Leo, 2020.3.21.

A: Looks like your credit card bill dropped a lot in recent months.

B: Yes. I didn't go to restaurants after coronavirus' breaking out. They're all closed.

A: So you cook at home? Does it take more time to cook by yourself than eating at restaurant or ordering take-out?

B: Like typing, driving and writing, cooking is a skill you need to learn. As you are more skilled with it, the benefit grows larger. Cooking is mainly about life style, not time or money. You can cook in a way you like.

A: What's the doctrine you follow when cooking?

B: Balanced nutrition is the key point of healthy diet. There are vegetables, meat, milk, bread, egg in my breakfast. I prefer origin tastes of food to highly cooked ones. Vegetables are plain sauteed with only vegetable oil and a little salt.

A: What's your style of food?

B: Potato, hot pepper, mushroom, noodles, egg, water melon, strawberry. Any thing soft and juicy. Artificial sweetener is evil, Last but not least, apple is your friend. Have you heard the song "An apple a day" by Aqua?

A: No. Why an apple a day?

B: An English phrase. But actually "an apple a day won't keep the doctor away", as the song said. To a coder, the equivalent is "no silver bullet".

A: Do you like junk food or fast food?

B: No. There are too much meat and too little vegetables in them.

A: But many people like it.

B: Remember another phrase: you are what you eat.

A: Do you like wine?

B: No, I get drunk even with a little alcohol. I don't like the feeling of losing control when getting dizzy.

A: But sometimes people do need it to forget or escape from something.

B: It makes sense. But a better way is looking straight at the thing you scared and figuring out how to control or live with it.

A: Do you smoke?

B: No. Cigarette won't make people more comfortable or more focused. But smokers suck without it. It makes me feel bad to be slave of cigarette. Meanwhile if you don't like second-hand smoke, never make it.
