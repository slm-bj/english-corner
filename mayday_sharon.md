A£ºWhat song was that? It seems that you are very fond of that.

B: You are pulling my leg, aren't you? That was Mayday's most popular song. Mayday! Have you ever heard any song of that group?

A: I have to say that I don't like rock&roll very much. They are always very loud and noisy. They drive me crazy. But why not tell me something about that group?

B: Sure. Mayday is my favourite music group. I have been a fan of them for more than fifteen years. And I have been to their concert two times in Beijing. The reasons I am crazy about them are not only their amazing music, but the spirits the music expresses. They always encourage the youth to keep pure friendship and love, to hold on their own dreams and to do what they really like. If you focus on their music, you can find power that makes you strong and confident. They teach us that the happiest life doesn't refer to earning so much money or living a big house, but to having friends who have the same goals like you, to doing a job that makes you happy and to having a dream that makes you passinate about life. Whenever I feel upset of lonely, their music is keeping me accompany. By the way, what genre of music you like most?

A: I am a classical music person. Beethoven, Mozart, Chopin£¬Debussy are composers I appreciate most. They are not so shallow as pop songs. And you can put your heart in peace during listening to different pieces of classical music.

B: Wow. Classical music! You must be very enjoy the inner happiness of a high mental state. I am a shallow person when compared to you.

A: Don't undermine yourself. I like listening to music, but my singing is out of tune. Each of us has unique potential capabilities and limitations.
