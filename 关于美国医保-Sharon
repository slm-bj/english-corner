Aï¼šHmmm. Actually, I don't quite understand. 
It seems that Obama administration implemented the law's tax penalty for not having coverage. 
But Trump administration did not care about if you have signed up for any health insurance.

B: Here's something very different from USA and China. 
Good and cheap health care has long eluded America. 
If you have outstanding debt as an American, 
it would have 52 percent chance of coming from medical area. 
If you don't have any medical insurance as an American, 
the charge for medical cares would be more than 2.5 times that of an insured people.

A: Well, that reminds me something very ironic depicted by the TV show of Big Bang Theory. 
Have you ever watched that show?

B: Yes, of course. 

A: Good. Can you remember Bernadette? 
She once said that a medication with side effects had been launched to the market with high price by her company. 
Then they launched another medication to cure the side effects caused by the previous one with higher price.

B: That is so-called information asymmetry in economics. 
Those with sufficient information are often in a more advantageous postion, 
while those with poor information are in a more disadvantaged position. 
If we only rely on the self-regulation of the market and do not add in some control mechanism, 
those in disadvantaged position will always suffer damage.

A: Let me guess. From your point of view, you don't quite support Trump administration about medical insurance, do you?

B: This is none of my business. Enjoy your own life~
