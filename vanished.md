A: Hi [Bob], Have you read [the article](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/02/14/business/wuhan-coronavirus-journalists.html)?

B: Hi [Alice]. I've read it. [lawyer Chen](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iwpr55PZEJ8) and 
[Fang Bin](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YUXV4Ih2xrk) published what they've seen,
then vanished. We haven't the right of free speech here.

A: Don't you think their videos spread fears among public at the very moment?
Although they are partially true?

B: Compared with the tragical truth, fears about unknown and rumors create more chaos and tragedies.

A: Why did they always show the dark sides, the losses, the failures of our nation?
It's their homeland, right? Why didn't they provide uplifting videos to encourage people?

B: Because many have done that. We have to see both good and bad, confirmations and criticism,
even malicious criticism.

A: Why we have to accept malicious criticism, instead of fighting back?
People will say we are cowards, we are self-abased before the westerners.

B: If sharp criticism disappears, mild criticism will become harsh.
If mild criticism is not allowed, silence will be considered having an axe to grind.
If silence is forbidden, dull praise is a crime.
If only one voice is allowed to exist, it must be a lie.

A: I think you confused malicious criticism with piercing one.

B: There are no clear borders between malicious and piercing criticism in complex situations.

A: Friends give piercing criticism, while enemies give malicious one.

B: Who are friends, who are enemy, who has the right to define?

A: While, maybe you're right. But the fact is most people think with emotion and attitude, instead of logic and rational.
They are not used to analyze what they say. They judge by commenters' identities.

B: Yes. Peole used to choose the easier path, instead of the right one.
It's a instinct of beings. But we must try our best to avoid this.
This the key point making us different from beasts.
To me, the former are enemies, the latter are friends.
No matter its nationality, race, color, sex orientation, religion, and so on.

A: Finally we have agreements about the following things:

We must distinguish facts from opinions in reports,
then build our opinions based on facts.
We should have more varieties of information sources to build the whole pictures.

The facts in [the article](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/02/14/business/wuhan-coronavirus-journalists.html) are true.
We agree our disagree about its opinions.

People should have freedom of speech.
