A: Hi [Bob], Have you read [the article](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/02/14/business/wuhan-coronavirus-journalists.html)?

B: Hi [Alice]. I've read it. [Lawyer Chen](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iwpr55PZEJ8) and 
[Fang Bin](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YUXV4Ih2xrk) published what they've seen,
then vanished. We don't have the right of free speech here.

A: Don't you think their videos spreaded fears among public at the very moment?
Although they were partially true?

B: Compared with the tragical truth, fears about unknown and rumors create more chaos and tragedies.

A: Why did they always show the dark sides, the losses, the failures of our nation?
It's their homeland, right? Why didn't they provide uplifting videos to encourage people?

B: Because many have done that. We have to see both good and bad aspects, confirmations and criticisms,
even malicious criticisms.

A: Why we have to accept malicious criticisms, instead of fighting back?
People will say we are cowards, we are self-abased before the westerners.

B: If sharp criticisms disappear, mild ones will become harsh.
If mild criticisms are not allowed, silence will be considered having an axe to grind.
If silence is forbidden, dull praise is a crime.
If only one voice is allowed to exist, it must be a lie.

A: I think you confused malicious criticisms with piercing ones.

B: There are no clear borders between malicious and piercing criticisms in complex situations.

A: Friends give piercing criticisms, while enemies give malicious ones.

B: Who are friends, who are enemies, who has the right to define?

A: Well, maybe you're right. But the fact is most people think with emotion and attitude, instead of logic and rationality.
They are not used to analyzing what they say. They judge by commenters' identities.

B: Yes. People are used to choosing the easier path, instead of the right one.
It's an instinct of beings. But we must try our best to avoid this.
This is the key point making us different from beasts.
To me, people who think with emotion and attitude are enemies, people who think with logic and rationality are friends,
no matter their nationalities, races, colors, sex orientations, religions, and so on.

A: Finally we have agreements about the following things:

* We must distinguish facts from opinions in reports,
then build our opinions based on facts.
We should have more varieties of information sources to build the whole picture.

* The facts in [the article](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/02/14/business/wuhan-coronavirus-journalists.html) are partially true.
We agree our disagreements about its opinions.

* People should have freedom of speech.
