A: What kind of music do you like? what style of music do you like?

B: Hmm, I have an interesting taste in music. I like all different kinds of genres.
When I listen to music I like catchy songs but I also like very complex songs or classical music. So my taste is a little bit strange. I don't like someone's taste in music because she only likes sing along songs and I don't really like that kind of music. 

A: Oh you know I love so many kinds of music. I have one song which is my favorite. The other day I heard an earworm and it had been stuck in my head for three days. It is so catchy. It's a great earworm. I love it so much that I use it as my ringtone so everytime or anytime somebody calls me I can listen to it again.

B: Do you love singing? Can you sing very well?
 
A: Well, I love catchy songs. I love to sing along to a lot of songs. But unfortunately I'm very very tone-deaf, which means that I can't sing really well at all. But I still love the song so much that I even set it as my ringtone.

B: How often do you like to see music live?

A: Oh I regularly go to concerts. Last night I went to see an amazing gig by this band from the city. This weekend I'm going to see a live show and I hope it will be a great performance. 

B: Who's your favorite singer?

A: I love this guy. I remember watching him before he was signed to a record label. But I can tell you after he was signed to the record label, his music style changed a little bit. It got a lot bigger with a lot more instruments being played.

A:  Do you have a favorite singer?

B: Oh I have one favorite singer whose name is J.J.. I remember watching him long ago. But five years after he had a massive hit, he was signed to a record label. And now he has a giant following, so many fans, a huge fan base. Many girls are head over heels in love with him and his music.

B: What kind/genre of music do you enjoy? 

A: Oh I love classical music with a fast tempo.

B: Do you like rock music?

A: Oh yes. I love heavy loud rock music with a fast tempo. Some rock songs are relaxing. But if I want to relax and be peaceful, I will listen to classical music. But for me, when I'm going to the gym, I like some upbeat piercing rock music.

B: I love hip-hop. I love very rhythmic hip-hop that can make me move. But sometimes I like soft relaxing hip-hop where the words will let me think about my life. 

A: You know I don't like K-Pop. For me K-Pop is too warm and lively. I like some fast tempo/melancholic rock music/punk music.

I love classical music if I want to relax it can be very relaxing for me when I am studying or when I want to just relax at home. 

I love some up-tempo rock music or some fast tempo punk music. For me it's so lively and it really makes me wake up and be active.

I love hip-hop. Hip-hop for me is very rhythmic and I like to go along with the beat when I work out.

I love K-pop. I love lively warm uplifing k-pop which is catchy and to make me move.

I love electronic music. I like lively electronic music but sometimes when I'm sad I like to listen to some melancholic electronic music to just relax me.

I love Jazz. I like all kinds of Jazz. I like upbeat jazz. I like piercing rhythmic jazz and sometimes I like some relaxing melancholic jazz on a Sunday night.

It's raining so heavily.= It's raining cats and dogs.
