It should be restricted and supervised by the people.
The more power it has, it becomes more dangerous to harm the civil rights.

A: People have quite different stories about governments in different countries.
Many people believe the government is their mentor, safeguard or even parent.
To them the country is a big family.

B: The government can be anything but parent. Parent makes money and raises kids.
While people give money to the government as taxes and keep it running.

B: Anyone will become dangerous when he gains great power.
People tend to believe himself smart and selfless, while others are stupid and shortsighted.
The achievements are owed to his rightness, while the failures are due to others' faults,
no matter how capable or weak he actually is.

A: What's the comment of the Democrats about this opinion?

B: They agree with this. But they argue that the social welfare is a part of civil right.
The government must provide it to every citizen.

A: That's fair. The Republicans have no way against it.

B: But the government can't make money by itself. All the welfare is paid by every citizen.
The Republicans believe this harm the freedom of choice of the citizens.
