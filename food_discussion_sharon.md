A: Would you like to pig out with us tonight?

B: Hmmm. Are you going to celebrate something?

A: No. Nothing special. It's a good idea to eat out once a while. Don't you think so?

B: You can say that again.(Exactly) It distresses me that I am not able to go out with you, but I have sharp stomachache. I almost can not stand it.

A: Sorry to hear that. But what's wrong with you? Did you eat something bad or unhealthy?

B: Er...My stomachache may have something to do with the food I ate yesterday. It was a litte spicy...

A: Oh, come on. Only a little spicy? Who are you kidding? You are well known that you are fond of Sichuan food. The spicer, the better.

B: Fine. Nothing can escape from your watery eyes. I overate at one of my favourite Sichuan food restaurants last night and got violent indigestion. I threw up many times after that and I hardly have any appetite. 

A：Poor guy. Try to eat some light food whenever you feel hungry.

B: Don't worry. I think I will get better soon. You want some advice about where to go for a pleasant dinner about Sichuan food?

A: It's nice of you to offer, but we plan to have some Western-style food for a change.

B: Western-style food is “Eat the scenery” but not “Eat taste”. I don’t really enjoy western food.

A: I disagree with you on this matter. Steak is my favourite. I prefer Fillet Mignon with medium well. And I like mashed potato, broccoli, mushroom to match my steak. They are mouth-watering.

B: Alright. Have a nice dinner.
