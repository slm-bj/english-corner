A: Hi [Bob], let's talk about the song "Vincent". I like its beautiful melody and poetic lyrics.

B: Hi [Alice]. Good taste!. Please read the lyrics, and let's see what can be found out.

A: OK. Here we go.

> Starry, starry night
>
> Paint your palette blue and gray
>
> Look out on a summer's day
>
> With eyes that know the darkness in my soul

B: It is about one of the most famous work of Vincent van Gogh, a Dutch post-impressionist painter:
The Starry Night, painted in June, 1889:

![The Starry Night](https://www.paintingmania.com/arts/vincent-van-gogh/large/starry-night-6_2843.jpg?version=17.11.06)

You can see the Moon, the Venus and other stars on the sky of a summer night.
Beneath the magical sky, there are shadowed hills, a cypress tree and a village.

A: Vincent is a genius with amazing imaginations.

B: Yep. However the Starry Night is not painted from memory completely.
The view of the work is verified from his bed room window, when he admitted himself to an asylum in Provence of southern France,
after he cut off his left ear.

A: Interesting. The second paragraph.

> Shadows on the hills
>
> Sketch the trees and the daffodils
>
> Catch the breeze and the winter chills
>
> In colors on the snowy linen land

Why "the winter chills"? It's a summer nigth.

B: Maybe the painting makes people feel cold.

A: Interesting explanations. The last paragraph of first section:

> Now I understand
>
> What you tried to say to me
>
> How you suffered for your sanity
>
> How you tried to set them free
>
> They would not listen. They did not know how
>
> Perhaps they'll listen now

B: Honestly, I think Vincent was a child all his life, with little "sanity" of adults.
For example, he declared his love to his recently widowed cousin Kee, 
who was 7 years older than him, and had a eight-year-old son.
Then he was refused with "No, nay, never".
But as an artist, honest and sensitivity make him different.
People perceive in his true humanity. Although this gave him so much pains.

A: So some say only people feeling pains write poets. OK the 2nd section:

> Starry, starry night
>
> Flaming flowers that brightly blaze
>
> Swirling clouds in violet haze
>
> Reflect in Vincent's eyes of china blue
>
> Colors changing hue
>
> Morning fields of amber grain
>
> Weathered faces lined in pain
>
> Are smoothed beneath the artist's Loving hand

B: This makes me recall his "The Potato Eaters":

A: Now comes the chorus:

> Now I understand
>
> What you tried to say to me
>
> How you suffered for your sanity
>
> How you tried to set them free
>
> They would not listen. They did not know how
>
> Perhaps they'll listen now

B: What does "chorus" mean?

A: In a pop song, verse is often narrative, and chorus often lyrical.
Some call chorus as song's climax.

B: Looks like chorus is always repetitive.

A: Exactly. Last paragraph of the 2nd section:

> For they could not love you
>
> But still your love was true
>
> And when no hope was left inside
>
> On that starry, starry night
>
> You took your life
>
> As lovers often do
>
> But I could have told you, Vincent
>
> This world was never meant for one as beautiful as you

B: These sentences are really heart-breaking.

A: Take it easy, You know he is not alone. This world has crushed so many beautiful souls,
and will crush more. Well, just a joke. The last section:

> Starry, starry night
>
> Portraits hung in empty halls
>
> Frameless heads on nameless walls
>
> With eyes that watch the world
>
> And can't forget
>
> Like the strangers that you've met
>
> The ragged men in ragged clothes
>
> The silver thorn of bloody rose
>
> Lie crushed and broken
>
> On the virgin snow
>
> Now I think I know
>
> What you tried to say to me
>
> How you suffered for your sanity
>
> How you tried to set them free
>
> They will not listen
>
> They're not listening still
>
> Perhaps, they never will

B: A beautiful song for a beautiful soul.

A: But as the song said, most people won't listen to him.
They are busy for money, power and fame.

B: Diversity counts. People live in their own styles.
Even not famous like Vincent, we are still cared and loved.
We are indispensable for each other. That's enough.
