A: Look, the Affordable Care Act, caming from the Obama administration, was struck down and the expanded Medicaid prompted by the Trump administration is expected in low-income adults.

B: Which plan do you think is good for most people?

A: I think the latter may be more acceptable. In all, 11.8 million people in all 50 states signed up for health insurance through the law's marketplaces in 2018. The new enrollment number for 2019 went down by 20 percent compared to the same period in 2018. But Kaiser tracking poll found that 59 percent of respondents living in the 14 states that had not yet expanded Medicaid wanted them to do so. What I concern is why did that happen.

B: Maybe we can find the answer from the rapidly spreading COVID-19 outbreak. As we know, the pandemic has claimed the lives of 26,059 people and infected 6.1 hundreds of thousands in US. The charge of screening for this disease is expensive for people who don't enroll in health insurance. So the skimpier, less expensive plan that does not meet the standards of the law is quite a good option for the low-income adults. 

A: Oh, yes. Maybe the price is the top concern for most people.
