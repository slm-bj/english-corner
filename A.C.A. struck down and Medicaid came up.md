A: Look, the Affordable Care Act, caming from the Obama administration, was struck down and the expanded Medicaid prompted by the Trump administration are expected in low-income adults.

B: Do you think which plan is good for most people?

A: I think the latter plan may be more acceptable. In all, 11.8 million people in all 50 states signed up for health insurance through the law's marketplaces in 2018. The new enrollment number for 2019 will go down by 20 percent compared to the same period in 2018. But last month's Kaiser tracking poll found that 59 percent of respondents living in the 14 states that have not yet expanded Medicaid want them to do so. What I concern is why did that happen?

B: Maybe we can find the answer from the rapidly spreading COVID-19 outbreak. As we know, the pandemic has claimed the lives of 26059 people and infected 6.1 hundreds of thousands in US. The charge of screening for this disease is expensive for people who don't enroll in health insurance. So the skimpier, less expensive plan that do not meet the standards of the law is quite a good option for the low-income adults, especially one popular provision of the law says that allows young people to stay on their parent' health insurance plan until they turn 26.

A: Oh, yes. Maybe the price is the top concern for most people.
